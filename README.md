yda-drupal
==========

Drupal theme and buildout for the YDA.

The base theme we're using is called Porto.  It's a responsive theme (mobile-friendly)
that we're customizing to behave more like the political theme we've selected from WordPress.

The "theme" branch is the main development branch for theme activity.
Our custom theme resides in sites/all/themes.

Any theme-related modules should be committed to the "module" branch.
Modules should be placed in sites/all/modules.
